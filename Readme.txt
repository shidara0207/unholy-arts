/// Technical issues //
- Running the game
Unholy Arts is a html game, and it's to be run on your browser. The game is periodically tested in both Firefox and Chrome. Internet Explorer and Edge are not supported.
Make sure you extract all contents from the game's .zip file to a given folder before you run the game.

- Saving the game
If you want to save your game for your next session, it is recommended that you save it to disk. If you save the game the standard way while you are on incognito mode or similar, your save will get deleted as soon as you close your window.
Save files are not expected to be compatible between different versions of the game. If you manage to load a save file on a different version than the one it was created, expect issues.
It is recommended that you save the game often and keep different files.

- Local Storage error
You may come accross a localStorage message error during the game, which means that your web browser has decided to stop providing extra memory for the game, which will provoke new issues for you down the line. In this case, it is recommended to:
* Make sure your device's disk space and memory aren't full or close to their limits.
* Load your latest save (may not be required).
* Save the game as a savefile using the "Save to Disk..." option in the Saves Menu from now on.
* Delete your saves stored in memory in the Saves Menu.
* From time to time, save and load the game as a file stored in your disk.
* Turn off the auto-save feature (often very helpful).
* Clear your browser's cache and cookies (often the most helpful step).
* If everything else fails, you may try using a different browser.

- Other issues?
Unholy Arts is still in alpha state, and you should expect to find bugs in the game. If you do, make sure you tell me! You can contact me on the game's page on itch.io, the different forum threads about the game opened by Deep Interactivity, and the game's Discord. When you report a bug, please provide as much context as possible. Sending me your latest save file would also be useful.

/// Customization ///
- Player custom avatar
If you want the player character to use a specific face and body, you can do so. Go to your Unholy Arts folder, and open img/portraits. Change the names of "custom-full.png" and "custom-avatar.png", place the images you wish to use in that folder, and give them the previous names. The avatar file should have dimensions of 200x200. You have more freedom for the full body file, but the most common dimensions are 300x500 and 340x500. When you're asked to select your appearance in game, select the custom choice.
